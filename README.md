# Quiz_FeProject

Frontend Individual Project -> Quiz Application:

This app generates 10 random questions each time the quiz is started from a question bank. Each question gets 10 seconds. When the timer ends, the next random question gets displayed. The user cannot go back to the previous question. When the user tries to go to the next question without selecting an option, an error message gets displayed. After the completion of quiz, the percentage gets displayed along with a button used to check the answers.
